            <h2>What's 2048?</h2>
            <p>2048 is a captivating puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid. 
                The objective is to combine tiles with matching numbers by sliding them in any of the four directions. 
                Each move causes all tiles to shift as far as possible in the chosen direction, and when two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with their sum. 
                The game introduces a new tile with each move, usually a 2 or 4. 
                Players aim to strategically merge tiles to create a tile with the number 2048, though the game can continue beyond this goal to achieve even higher numbers. 
                The challenge lies in managing the grid space and planning moves to avoid running out of possible moves.
